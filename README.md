# Spaceship Generator

A Blender script to procedurally generate 3D spaceships from a random seed.

Usage
-----
* Install Blender 3.0 or greater: http://blender.org/download/
* Download newest `add_mesh_SpaceshipGenerator.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/ldo/blender_spaceship_generator/releases) section
* Under File > User Preferences... > Add-ons > Install From File... open the downloaded ZIP file
* Under File > User Preferences... > Add-ons enable this script (search for "spaceship")
* Add a spaceship in the 3D View under Add > Mesh > Spaceship

How it works

* Start with a box.
* Build the hull: Extrude the front/rear faces several times, adding random translation/scaling/rotation along the way.
* Add asymmetry to the hull: Pick random faces and extrude them out in a similar manner, reducing in scale each time.
* Add detail to the hull: Categorize each face by its orientation and generate details on it such as engines, antenna, weapon turrets, lights etc.
* Sometimes apply horizontal symmetry.
* Add a Bevel modifier to angularize the shape a bit.
* Apply materials to the final result.
* Take over the universe with your new infinite fleet of spaceships.

Extreme examples
----------------
The following screenshots were created using extreme values for the number of hull segments and asymmetry segments to show how the algorithm works.

Tips and Tricks
---------------
* The seeds used for generating random geometry and materials default to random integers,
but you can replace these with any string. Different seeds are chosen every time you create
a new spaceship, but they do not change when you edit the parameters for regenerating the
current spaceship (unless you change them).
* Materials are generated with heavy use of node groups, to allow easy customization.
For example, all colours are derived from a common colour-scheme node group, so changes
made here can affect all relevant materials for a single spaceship at once. The node groups
work across both Eevee and Cycles renderers.
* You can go further, and replace the textures with your own ones. `hull_normal.png` is a
normal map that adds extra surface detail “greebles”. `hull_lights_emit.png` defines the positions
of the windows; it is used as an emissive texture to make them glow.
